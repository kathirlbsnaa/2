    <h1>History of Indian Cricket:</h1>
    <pre style="font-size:large;font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">              Cricket was introduced to India by European merchant sailors in the 18th century, and the first cricket club was established in 1792.
India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at Lord's, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket
status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, 
winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strengthin the 1970s with the emergence of players such as Gavaskar, Viswanath, Kapil Dev, and the Indian
spin quartet.</pre><br><br>
